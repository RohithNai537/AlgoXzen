## 🧠 Problem Statement

Developers and creators on blockchain platforms often face challenges such as:
- Lack of *AI-integrated tools* for smart contract creation and debugging.
- Absence of *trusted verification systems* for digital content and media.
- Fragmented ecosystems requiring multiple platforms for development, auditing, and verification.

*AlgoXzen* addresses these gaps by offering an *AI-driven, all-in-one platform* that merges blockchain trust with intelligent automation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Enable *AI-assisted smart contract generation* using Algopy/PyTeal.
- ✅ Provide *document, audio, and video verification* via tokenization (NFT/ASA).
- ✅ Allow *on-chain audits* and vulnerability detection for Algorand contracts.
- ✅ Offer *natural language blockchain exploration* with real-time insights.
- ✅ Ensure *secure ownership and access control* using smart contracts.
